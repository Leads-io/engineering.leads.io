Interpreting specifications and applying them practically to new and existing solutions. Analysing stakeholder requirements and how to transcribe them into solution-specific output. Engaging with the right stakeholders and peers to produce relevant and meaningful system proposals.

### Level 2
Is able to follow basic specification set by others, clarifying details with their team.
- Works to specifications already provided by other team members.
- May require guidance on how to implement a specification within their domain.
- Regularly discusses their planned approach with a more senior team member.
- Understands acceptance criteria, and can contribute to producing them as part of a group workshop.

### Level 3
Regularly writes specification for basic features, working with more senior members for analysing and specifying more complex work.
- Is comfortable contributing to understanding the problem and coming up with a solution as part of a team or pairing.
- Is able to interpret specifications and implement a solution within their domain.
- Is able to write basic specifications but requires supervision/guidance for more complex features.
- Is able to support senior team members with code/system audits to identify issues and common problems and contribute to a report document as required.

### Level 4
Builds up requirements and proposes detailed specifications to new or existing stakeholders. Considers and manages the impact of changes on other domains or areas of their application.
- Is comfortable analysing problems within a subdomain, building up requirements and turning them into a simple specification document, or part of a larger one, for submission as a formal pitch to stakeholders.
- Considers the non-technical requirements and impact of a system, for example the manual effort required to perform the administration of the feature.
- Contributes answers to stakeholder requirements using their technical and domain experience.
- Conducts technical investigations ("spikes") to identify and compare possible approaches for small problems, documenting the outcome.

### Level 5
Converts complex problems into stakeholder-facing specifications, and conducts audits of existing applications to recommend improvement. Delegates and supports other members to analyse and specify in their domains.
- Has the experience to break down large problems and compose them into stakeholder-facing specifications.
- Supervises others in creating specification documents, delegating responsibilities as necessary without needing to be directly involved in the analysis.
- Performs a complete audit of an existing application and/or system to identify issues and common problems, and produce a suitable report document for a stakeholder.
- Can produce scenarios to cover the main acceptance criteria as well all reasonable variations and edge-cases. Understands when edge-cases are exceeding the bounds of obscurity.
- Conducts technical investigations ("spikes") to identify and compare possible approaches for highly complex problems, documenting the outcome.

### Level 6
Supports pitches to new or existing stakeholders and can communicate complex systems through documents and presentations. Works with others to transform high-level business requirements into technical recommendations.
- Produces pitch-level analysis of stakeholder requirements to architect a large-scale solution.
- Collaborates with other team members and the stakeholder to document business needs and assumptions to help inform the eventual specification.
- Considers multiple facets of a system, including those outside of their area of expertise in order to determine what other providers are required to produce and be responsible for.
- Can provide alternative solutions, communicating at a high level the implications and cost of each.
- Communicates their designs and visions through various means including documents, presentations and various types of diagrams at different levels of abstraction (system, data flow, component, etc).
