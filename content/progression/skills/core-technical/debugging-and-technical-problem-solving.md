title: 'Debugging & Technical Problem Solving'
---

Determining the cause of technical problems and applying appropriate solutions.

### Level 1
No experience debugging

### Level 2 *JUNIOR*
Inexperienced at debugging but able to fix simple problems with input from others.
 - Usually requires assistance to identify and address problems.
 - Attempts to recreate basic issues from bug reports provided by others.

### Level 3 *MID*
Using tools to investigate and fix common issues, collaborating with their team especially on complicated problems.
 - Investigates and fixes common issues, often needing help with more complex issues.
 - Capable of debugging simple programs, for example by reading through error logs and using step-through debugging.
 - Knows the appropriate tools and approaches when debugging code.
 - Reports and documents bugs for others, including how to recreate the issue.

### Level 4 *SENIOR*
Guiding their team to mitigate technical issues by guiding prioritisation, tooling, and approach. Taking the lead on resolving some difficult technical issues.
  - Capable of debugging complex end-to-end issues, sometimes needing to pair on very tough issues.
  - Has established approaches to diagnosing and narrowing-down causes by process of elimination.
  - Helps others solve problems with the goal of making them more independent for debugging tasks.
  - Ensures the relevant tools exist within the project and are available for use by the rest of the team.
  - Collaborates openly with bug reporters to try and narrow down hard-to-reproduce issues.
  - Triages open issues alongside new work, advising on priorities by considering risk and core journeys.

### Level 5
An authority for helping solve problems in their domain, even in unfamiliar contexts. Managing and mitigating problems with no simple solutions, and supporting others with their debugging techniques.
 - Capable of debugging almost any issue, given enough time.
 - Knows how to mitigate a problem where no solution can be found in a timely manner.
 - Has established approaches to diagnosing an issue that cannot be replicated in a test/development environment.
 - Regularly assists others with critical or tough issues.
 - Identifies, prioritises, and escalates problems within a project that need to be addressed in order to meet the stakeholder's goals.

### Level 6
Establishing our best practice for how we manage technical issues across our projects.
 - An expert in helping others isolate issues and solve them quickly.
 - Helps teams establish strategies for debugging and diagnosing problems on the project.
 - Finds common patterns of problems across projects and proposing solutions to be implemented community-wide.
 - Advises on how teams should manage technical debt, and how to prioritise this work for stakeholders.
