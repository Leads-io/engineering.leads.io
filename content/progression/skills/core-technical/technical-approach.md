Your technical approach should ensure high quality code development.

### Level 1
Learning about different software engineering techniques and standards

### Level 2
Writes code that adheres to existing code standards.
- Follows coding and styling standards for their framework, language, or project.
- Modifies existing components within an established project.

### Level 3
Able to write basic tests and create simple components within an established project. Familiar with the goal of code and test standards to create and maintain robust features.
- Demonstrates and applies basic practical knowledge of test-driven approaches.
- Defines new components by following an already established project architecture.

### Level 4
Uses good technical approaches by default, relying on test coverage and good structure to create and maintain robust features. Knows how to effectively use these approaches for complex features, and makes recommendations to improve approaches on their project.
- Has leveraged automated testing tools on multiple projects.
- Prioritises maintainability and reusability when defining components and guides other team members on how to adopt a modular and decoupled approach to development.
- Guides other team members on good technical approaches.
- Follows conventions within project to ensure uniformity and ease of future maintainability

### Level 5
An authority, guiding others and recommending improvements to our technical approach on multiple projects.
- Has introduced a new automated testing technique or improved an existing one on a project (e.g. added better support for in-memory testing, suggested a new way of organising test-related files, configured and enabled a new testing tool, enacted a performance optimisation on the test suite).
- Guides others on automated testing techniques and writing pragmatic and effective tests.
- Has established a standard component-driven approach for certain development tasks and introduced it to multiple projects

### Level 6
An evangelist for good technical approaches
- Is a notable promoter of good technical approach across our engineering team, actively guiding teams and individuals.
- Has led a component driven strategy across multiple technologies and influenced the modularity and maintainability of a full application stack (backend, frontend).
- Contributes to proposals for decoupled or headless projects and describes their benefit to non-technical stakeholders.
- Is aware of changes in this area outside of Leads.io, bringing topics for discussion and influencing our best practice as appropriate.
