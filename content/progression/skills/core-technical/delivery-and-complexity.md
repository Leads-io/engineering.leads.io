### Level 1
Learning what it takes to deliver code professionally.
 - Is learning under close instruction.
 - Follows a combination of self-learning, structured tutorship and shadowing more experienced engineers to learn how to work on projects.

### Level 2
Works under supervision but trusted to deliver on their own within clearly defined areas of low complexity.
 - Works on simple tasks from larger problems that have been broken down and managed for them.
 - Produces valuable output for their project, but at a slower rate compared to more senior engineers and often with several rework iterations.
 - Is expected to develop solutions to simple problems independently, submit for peer review and not necessarily be involved in the release process.
 - Pairs with more senior engineers to tackle harder problems.

### Level 3
Trusted to deliver code against pre-designed solutions within their area of expertise to budget.
 - Provides solutions to simple and medium complexity problems and participates in the release process.
 - Produces valuable output at a rate comparable to senior engineers when working on challenges within their knowledge domain and up to medium complexity. They often require more rework than Seniors for their code to be merged.
 - Is able to work within estimates they have provided, generally.
 - Is capable of developing and releasing a medium complexity application with minimal oversight.
 - Is pragmatic about the time they spend on a problem before escalating to others.
 - Considers most edge cases when developing their code.

### Level 4
Trusted to design the solutions and implement the code for complex work within their area of expertise to budget.
 - Tackles large components such as integrations or significant features.
 - Produces valuable output at a consistent rate across most aspects of their work with sufficient domain knowledge and experience to keep learning curves short.
 - Delivers solutions to more complex problems (e.g. technical design and implementation of a 3rd party integration, setting up the testing architecture for a project, building a library that can benefit multiple projects) with minimal oversight and is pragmatic about seeking assistance when necessary.
 - Is capable of managing a predefined application deployment process.
 - Understands the principle of feature toggling to streamline lead time and how to introduce it to an in-flight project.
 - Can analyse legacy systems of medium complexity for maintenance/auditing and smaller improvements within their fields of expertise
 - Considers edge cases and handles them pragmatically within project constraints.

### Level 5
Designs solutions for complex work for their team, supporting and overseeing as well as delivering their own value.
 - Is capable of architecting full applications or larger complex sub-projects within an area of expertise.
 - Produces valuable output quickly and efficiently for themselves, although still delivering at rates comparable to a Senior I as they invest more of their time upskilling and unblocking others. Very little rework is required for their PRs
 - Is capable of building distributed architecture with remote services (via suitable APIs), co-ordinating the transfer of data between multiple systems.
 - Helps to define a deployment process suitable for the team, according to project goals and complexities.
 - Understands the impact of deploying at any given time, any potential downtime, how to rollback and restore to a previous state.
 - Can analyse legacy systems of high complexity for the purposes of auditing and ongoing project development.

### Level 6
Tackles the most complex architectural challenges, irrespective of domain and legacy. Sets the architectural blueprint that allows the rest of the team to succeed.
 - Can architect large-scale systems at a high level to solve complex business and technical challenges on any leads.io engagement regardless of domain, and communicate the design clearly.
 - Can architect detailed complex systems to a fine-grain detail within their area of expertise.
 - Is aware of new solutions, services and architecture in the market/ecosystem that are relevant to the technology in use, and able to advise their appropriate adoption.
 - Focuses on enabling and maintaining high team value and throughput through upskilling and unblocking other engineers.
 - Contributes to multiple delivery projects to offer advice and guidance.
 - Can apply their architectures on brownfield engagements after detailed analysis of complex existing technical estates and provide a sensible approach to deliver the modernisation.
