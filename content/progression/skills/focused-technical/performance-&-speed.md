The consideration of performance during development. Diagnosing and fixing performance problems in new and existing code or applications and the use of appropriate tools to assess site and application performance.

### Level 2
Has a basic awareness of the importance of performance.
- Is learning how to improve the performance of their implementations with support from more senior engineers.

### Level 3
Is able to write efficient code, avoiding common performance issues especially within their domain.
can use profiling tools to a basic level.
- Aware of caching but not necessarily able to select the best approach.
- Is aware of web vitals and is broadly aware of topics in their domain that can impact these measurements.

### Level 4
Confidently handles common performance challenges through effective use of tooling, including profiling.
- Can write efficient code, and understands the difference between doing so and micro-optimising
- Can micro-optimise code, knows different methods to do so and which to choose situationally.
- Has a good grasp of profiling tools and uses them instinctively.
- Aware of different caching mediums and how to use them.
- Judges when to use caching and when to optimise the code.
- Understands web vitals and can define work towards achieving specific goals for these measurements.
- Can identify and choose from multiple solutions for common performance issues.
- Supports other team members to learn and improve their skill for performance-related work.

### Level 5
Proactively handles performance topics, guiding others' technical approaches and educates stakeholders on the impact of good performance. Sets project-level goals for performance and judges when to stop investing in performance.
- Is keenly aware of performance when peer reviewing.
- Has a proactive approach to caching for performance.
- Has a full end-to-end knowledge of the impact of optimisations.
- Knows how to leverage multiple performance analysis tools.
- Works with other senior members to set goals or work to improve performance.
- Knows when to stop optimising considering diminishing returns and project constraints.
- Can guide stakeholders on the practical value of tracking web vitals and how it impacts their end users to help prioritise work related to performance.

### Level 6
Defines and promotes our best practice across multiple teams. Is a technical authority for performance and can advise on improvements for any context.
- Evangelises about performance and promotes this across projects, impacting design decisions and helping teams make trade-off decisions.
- Drives the performance audit strategy for new and existing projects.
- Advises teams on caching strategies at a high level.
- Is able to advise on performance strategy and improvements even in unfamiliar contexts.
- Recommends training topics to improve our competency for performance-related topics.
