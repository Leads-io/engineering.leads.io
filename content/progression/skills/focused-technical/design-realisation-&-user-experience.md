The process of interpreting design references, prototyping and accurately replicating them, while taking into account user experience concerns and technical limitations. Iterating on the implementation and design of features, interactions, and interfaces to meet usability and accessibility requirements.

### Level 2
Can implement basic responsive sites from designs.
- Able to implement a mostly-accurate representation from design references.
- Interprets and follows visual design and branding guidelines to create consistent and impactful user experience.
- Familiar with considerations for implementing responsive designs for a variety of browsers and devices.

### Level 3
Understands and considers the approaches for implementing robust designs. Interprets and collaborates on designs and implementations.

- Able to produce an accurate representation from design references or prototyping programmes, including responsive designs.
- Understands how to implement features compatible with a variety of browsers and devices, is able to test them for compatibility.
- Understands and applies usability and accessibility requirements defined for a project, supporting more junior members to work within these requirements.
- Proactively asks questions about designs, escalating to the design team or a senior member of the team as appropriate.
- Proactively interprets cases not documented in the provided design references, including interactions and layouts at various viewports.
- Sometimes uses screenshots or video recordings to accompany work as an example of the changes included.

### Level 4
Proactively collaborates with designers through every stage of a project, defining deliverables and identifying limitations or opportunities. Considers wider topics when approaching new work and measures or anticipates the need of end-users.

- Collects user or stakeholder feedback on implementations and consults with designers on this feedback.
- Applies progressive enhancement and graceful degradation approaches, and understands which to use in what cases.
- Makes recommendations on designs to help improve build efficiency, performance, usability, and accessibility.
- Is capable of setting up A/B testing tools, suggest testing scenarios, and advise on the interpretation of the testing results.
- Understands how features are linked to user or stakeholder needs and the wider context, so that they make decisions with the user in mind.
- Provides guidance to designers on what deliverables are required, specifying level of detail, timelines, formats, etc.
- Might be able to translate tracking data or UX findings into specific recommendations for technical approach.
- Able to quickly prototype changes for consideration, and demonstrate these changes in screenshots, recordings, or on calls.

### Level 5
Implements advanced designs and theming systems. Identifies and escalates opportunities to improve user experience for administrators and end users.

- Able to implement complex visual designs and animations.
- Translates user or stakeholder feedback of implementations into alternative design recommendations, collaborating with the design team.
- Recommends improvements to existing interfaces, for example making the admin interface of existing platform easier to use.
- Can work with the design team to engineer a multi-theme system and communicate the value to the stakeholder.
- Is able to develop, suggest, and implement an A/B testing strategy to target set goals.

### Level 6
Leads the collaborative process between the design and engineering teams. Ensures project teams are using processes that result in high-quality and robust implementations.

- Works with the designers to identify opportunities to improve our ways of working.
- Guides and supports engineers across Leads.io and advises on approaches for project teams.
- Identifies areas of weakness and makes plans for improving the skills of our team.
