Object orientation and how to use it effectively to architect modern solutions.

### Level 1
No knowledge of object-oriented programming

### Level 2
New to object-oriented programming.
- Has a grounding in OO and is able to write simple classes and interfaces.
- Understands inheritance and the different levels of scope within a class.
- has minimal exposure to, and understanding of, design patterns.

### Level 3
Understands the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and applies them in their day-to-day work, often needing input on class design.
- Is fluent in OO fundamentals and can apply them in their respective language.
- Is learning SOLID principles and/or types of design pattern (behavioural, creational, structural), and is starting to incorporate them into their work.
- Understands anti-patterns and the reasons why some approaches are preferred over others (e.g. composition vs inheritance).

### Level 4
Writes well-architected object-oriented code by default and helps others learn and apply good techniques.
aware of most design patterns and uses them appropriately.
- Knows SOLID principles and applies them where feasible/possible.
- Assists others on good design.

### Level 5
An authority for others to follow on good design patterns with significant proven experience. Understands the trade-offs and when not to apply these patterns.
- Adept at well-architected OO code, able to advise and collaborate on solutions that may not appear obvious to others.
- Has significant experience with many design patterns and knows when to use them situationally.
- Is seen as a technical authority for well-written code on the team that others will turn to.
- Understands the virtues and drawbacks of using these techniques and applies them pragmatically.
- Openly teaches good techniques, and intuitively understands why we adopt these approaches.

### Level 6
An evangelist for object-oriented programming and design principles. Keeps Leads.io's best practice up to date with industry trends through discussion and cross-project consultation.
- Preaches good design, but also a pragmatic and accessible approach to multiple teams, helping manage trade-offs to quality / readability / efficiency.
- Is aware of evolving architectural trends in the industry, and where they offer improvements on existing implementations.
- The go-to person when code reviews may be contentious in terms of design
