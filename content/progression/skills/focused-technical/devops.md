Bridging traditional software engineering with the world of ops, with a focus on continuous integration/continuous delivery, automation, provisioning, monitoring, resilience and scalability.

### Level 2
Can operate development environment and has basic knowledge of how processes interact with the wider infrastructure
- Can perform basic operations like starting VMs or docker environments
- Can perform some rudimentary debugging in certain situations e.g. restarting a webserver, debugging a CURL request
- Largely a consumer of the ops stack, rather than a contributor

### Level 3
Is familiar with the tools, services and processes commonly used on projects to support the team on day-to-day tasks.
- Is comfortable pairing with others to resolve common engineering and pipeline related environment issues
- Can install and configure the tools and services most commonly used on projects, such as GitLab, nginx, php-fpm, mysql, docker, docker-compose
- Makes tool and service recommendations based on already well understood and documented architecture patterns

### Level 4
Can document and implement an end-to-end project pipeline adhering to best practice of the chosen architecture. With appropriate guidance, can implement more complex architectures and pipelines.
- Is active in providing ops insight to application architecture decisions
- Can pair with an engineer to debug and diagnose application-specific issues with ops insight
- Can decide on an appropriate architecture and CI/CD pipeline for a project based on documented patterns, but knows how and when to deviate in minor ways from these standards to satisfy stakeholder requirements.
- Is proficient with the tooling used on more complex projects such as kubernetes, helm, grpc, prometheus and other associated tools in the distributed application ecosystem.
- Has in-depth knowledge of a cloud hosting provider, especially around the services most applicable to the documented architectures eg. compute, containers, database, cache, queuing and CDN.
- Is able to make hosting recommendations from a list of vetted options.

### Level 5
Work with project teams who have non-standard requirements to plan out an appropriate architecture and pipeline.
- Can mentor and advise less senior engineers on more complex and less commonly used architectures.
- Is able to debug, diagnose and advise on more complex inter-service and network issues relating to the application.
- Can plan out architectures and pipelines where project requirements deviate greatly from existing architecture patterns, or do not match an existing pattern at all.
- Can advise on appropriate hosting providers when none of the already vetted options are appropriate.
- Is familiar with various hosting paradigms; PaaS, CaaS, SaaS, IaaS, DIY, and the associated pros and cons of each.
- Is familiar with distributed architecture concepts and options such as SOA and Microservices.

### Level 6
Aware of wider industry trends and technologies, helps to establish the architectural patterns to be used by projects of varying types and complexity.
- Will consider new and upcoming technologies and how they might benefit projects and work within existing and new architectures.
- Can plan and document pipelines and architectures, of varying complexity to be used as standard across projects.
- Can facilitate a team in assessing the suitability of tools and technologies where you may have very little existing knowledge or experience.
- Is aware of developments in the industry of existing technologies and how they might impact projects and reference architectures that are utilising those technologies, for example a major version update of such technology, an older version becoming end-of-life, or of a technology being discontinued.
