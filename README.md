# Engineering Handbook

This is the Leads.io engineering handbook. It contains everything about how we work as an engineering department. It's inspired by the [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/) and [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/engineering/handbook) handbooks

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn how to change functionality.
